    "longDescription": "Flex is a responsive web application that allows users to track their weight, intake, and workouts while monitoring their progress to goals over time. The frontend was developed using React, and the backend uses Java Spring Boot and MySQL. I worked on this project with 4 other students from the University of Pittsburgh as part of a Software Engineering course. Part of the requirements for this project was to use Agile Scrum as the basis for our software development methodology. We performed requirements analysis, created diagrams (including class, activity, use case, etc.), and planned and tracked our progress using backlogs and user stories maintained in a Trello board. My primary responsibility for the project was to design and implement most of the frontend. I created prototypes in Figma, then transferred these into a working app with React. I also created the logo and helped to develop APIs and decide the structure and scope of the app. [CHALLENGES]",

I designed the application in Figma according to the client's specifications. Once they were satisfied with the design, I implemented the design using React, TypeScript, GSAP, and Locomotive Scroll for the frontend, and Firebase for authentication and to store the files and metadata. The client-facing interface features a parallax-scrolling gallery and gallery item description pages, which have custom-made audio players. The admin-facing interface features item uploading, editing, and deletion. Etheric is deployed live [https://etheric-fc36d.web.app/]here.",
