    "longDescription": "Flex is a responsive web application that allows users to track their weight, intake, and workouts while monitoring their progress to goals over time. The frontend was developed using React, and the backend uses Java Spring Boot and MySQL. I worked on this project with 4 other students from the University of Pittsburgh as part of a Software Engineering course. Part of the requirements for this project was to use Agile Scrum as the basis for our software development methodology. We performed requirements analysis, created diagrams (including class, activity, use case, etc.), and planned and tracked our progress using backlogs and user stories maintained in a Trello board. My primary responsibility for the project was to design and implement most of the frontend. I created prototypes in Figma, then transferred these into a working app with React. I also created the logo and helped to develop APIs and decide the structure and scope of the app. [CHALLENGES]",

The application interface was created using Flutter. I also used Firebase as the database to store users, groups, and messages, as well as to securely authenticate users. This project was designed and developed entirely by me, with the goal of learning as much about Flutter as possible while using Firebase for the first time. I also used Adobe XD to develop and compare design ideas. Chat App is deployed live [https://chatapp-ba297.web.app/]here.",
